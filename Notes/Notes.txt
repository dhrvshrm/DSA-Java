- Prerequisites:

    2. Git (with GIT_HOME set and added to PATH with LTS version)
    3. Eclipse/VSCode (with latest version)

- How JAVA code is running in the system?
    JDK (+ Development Tools) -> JRE (+ Libraries) -> JVM (+ Interpreter) -> OS (+ Hardware) -> Output

    - Below is the flow of how JAVA code is executed in the system:
        JAVA Code -> Compilation -> Byte Code 
        -> Interpretation -> Execution -> JIT Compilation 
        -> Garbage Collection -> Security
        -> Output

    - Compilation: The JAVA code is compiled into byte code using javac command.
    - Interpretation: The byte code is interpreted by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and executed.
    - Execution: The JVM executes the byte code and produces the output.
    - JIT Compilation: The JVM uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation to improve the performance of the code.
    - Garbage Collection: The JVM performs garbage collection to free up memory.
    - Security: The JVM provides security by running the code in a sandbox environment. 

- How JAVA code is executed in the system?
    1. Write a JAVA code and save it with .java extension.
    2. Compile the code using javac command.
    3. Run the code using java command.

- How to compile and run JAVA code?
    1. Open command prompt.
    2. Go to the directory where the JAVA file is saved.
    3. Compile the code using javac command.
        Syntax: javac <filename>.java
        Example: javac Hello.java
    4. Run the code using java command.
        Syntax: java <filename>
        Example: java Hello
